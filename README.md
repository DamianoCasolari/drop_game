# A game to raise public awareness about sea pollution

A little initial curiosity followed by the start button, the game consists of not letting the drops of oil fall into the sea. 
If these reach the sea you will lose a life and the sea will be more polluted.
Every 20 points you level up and the drops will fall faster. 
The points are awarded based on the distance they fall, so the lower you block the drops, the more points you earn.
Once the lives run out, the game ends
